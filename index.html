				<h1>Funding</h1>
					<p>Access to finance can be one of the biggest problems facing a business, whether it be in an early stage venture or as the company plans to expand. This research focusses on start-up businesses and identifies <span epub-type="stretchsummary">four common routes to financing new businesses:</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> <br/><br/>


					1. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Bootstrap</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> In the business context, bootstrap is a business with very little financial restraints or starting a business without parting with equity. This may involve personal or family savings; grants; competitions and accelerators; or taking on debt.</span> <br/> 

					2. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Grants, Accelerators and Competitions</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> To fund the initial stage of their business many participants in the authors research entered competitions, took part in at least one accelerator and received grants. 

					 </span><br/> 

					3. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Debt</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> Whilst debt is not encouraged for early stage businesses, <a href="https://www.bankofireland.com/">Bank of Ireland</a> and <a href="http://www.microfinanceireland.ie/">Microfinance Ireland</a> are some of the institutions identified that will offer loans to early stage businesses.</span><br/> 

					4. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Equity</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail">Three institutions were identified for offereing funding in return for equity: <a href="http://www.ndrc.ie">National Digital Research Centre (NDRC)</a>, <a href="https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/funding-supports/Company/HPSU-Funding/">Enterprise Ireland High Potential Start-Up Fund</a>, <a href="http://www.hban.org/">Angel Investment with Halo Business Angel Network (HBAN)</a> </span><br/>
					</span>
					</p>

				<h1>Technology</h1>

				<p>The level of technology intensity is a contributing factor in what resources one may use. When additional Research and Development are required, technology intensity is thought to be <span epub-type="stretchsummary">high.</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> There are a variety of options within Trinity College Dublin and further afield where you can partner to work on technologically intense aspects of your product/service, such as <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Technology Transfer Offices (TTO's)</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> A technology transfer is the transfer of technology from the originator to a secondary user. It occurs in a variety of different ways: from large businesses to smaller ones; from governments to businesses; from universities to businesses; across borders and among universities themselves. These TTO's are dedicated to identifying and exploiting research that has potential commercial interest. Many universities and institutes of technology have their own TTO. Nationally, Enterprise Ireland supports the Technology Transfer through the formation of <span epub-type="stretchsummary"> six consortia:</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> <br/><br/>

				1. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Maynooth University Consortium </span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail">, which includes Maynooth University, Athlone Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow.</span> <br/> 
				2. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">DRIC Consortium</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail">, which includes Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, National College of Ireland, Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art Design and Technology and Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies </span><br/> 
				3. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Dublin City University Consortium</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail">, which includes Dublin City University and Dundalk Institute of Technology. </span><br/> 
				4. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">Ignite West Consortium</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail">, which includes National University of Ireland Galway, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Galway Mayo Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Sligo.</span><br/>

				6. <span epub-type="stretchsummary">UCT Consortium</span><span epub-type="stretchdetail">, which includes University College Cork, Cork Institute of Technology and Teagasc-Agriculture and Food Development Authority. </span> <br/>

								
				<br/>University College Dublin (UCD) and Trinity College Dublin (TCD) have formed their own TTO's, UCDinnovation and The Office of Corporate Partnership and Knowledge Exchange (OCPKE) helping to create <span epub-type="stretchsummary"> successful technology spin-outs.</span> <span epub-type="stretchdetail"> Successful Technology spin-outs in Ireland include:
